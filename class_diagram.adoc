= A test for embedding a SVG image

.Caption for a SVG diagram
image::Vsw9cGkj8bJjEBr6.svg[width=417]

* I'd like to remove a redundant vertical space between the diagram above and the caption.
* I suppose Height 275 below is too much.

* There is still a redundant vertical space even when I do not have a caption, so the redundant space seems to be inside the image.

* However, the diagram becomes too small if I set the height as well as the width.
* And there still exists a redundant vertical space. I'd like to remove it!
